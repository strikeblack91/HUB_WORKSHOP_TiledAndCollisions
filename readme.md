# Tiled

Tiled is a 2D map level editor with which you can create 2D map for RPG, platformers and others games.\
Tiled is highly flexible. It can be used to create maps of any size, with no restrictions on the number of layers or assets that can be used.\
It can also generate files with different informations about the created map.\
\
Today we are going to use JSON files, to generate some collisions in C, that you could use for your RPG for example.\
